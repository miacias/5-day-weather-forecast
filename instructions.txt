06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Your Task
dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}

Hint: Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?

You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.
